    <p>What kind of bucket list doesn’t include the Great Pyramids of Giza in Egypt? Believe it or not, the Giza pyramids are fairly easy to visit on a day trip from Cairo, the capital of Egypt.Built in 2560 BC, the Great Pyramid of Giza was the tallest man-made object in the world for 3,800 years. It’s the oldest of the Seven Wonders Of The Ancient World, and the only one still standing today. Visiting the Egypt pyramids is a pretty simple experience, and there’s not a whole lot to do there except gaze at the big piles of rock, but it’s still a profound and unique experience that every traveler should check off their list.This travel guide will explain how you can visit the Egyptian pyramids on your own, with or without a tour, and with a very modest budget and minimal planning!</p>

    <h2>Best Day Tours To The Egypt Pyramids</h2>
    <p>First of all, if you’re on a tight schedule and want to skip the extra steps involved in arranging your own trip to the pyramids, or if you’d rather travel in a tour group for safety or convenience, there are options for doing that.There are a number of companies that offer prearranged day tours to the Pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx for as low as $45 USD, complete with hotel transfer, optional camel ride, and same day return to Cairo. If you’d rather make your own arrangements and go without a group, that’s covered next.</p>

    <h2>How To Get To The Giza Pyramids</h2>
    <p>The Great Pyramids are located on the outskirts of Giza, a suburb of Cairo, Egypt.

The nearest airport is the Cairo International Airport (CAI), which is served by a bunch of international airlines. You can shop for flights to Cairo at Skyscanner.From the Cairo airport, it’s a 1 hour drive to Giza. The arrivals zone has plenty of taxis you can take, but I used Uber and I would highly recommend this because it’s much cheaper and probably safer too.Do not rent a car in Egypt unless you are familiar with driving in the Middle East! Traffic in Arab countries is dangerous and chaotic, and you’ll be much better off going with a driver who’s familiar with how the traffic works here.Besides, the drivers in Egypt are pretty affordable — as of 2025, the price for an Uber ride from Cairo to Giza can be as low as 340 EGP (~$7 USD).</p>

<h2>Giza Pyramids: What To Expect</h2>
<p>If you’re staying at least one night in Giza, which I’d recommend, then you can drop off your luggage first at your hotel and then easily walk to the entrance of the pyramids and sphinx.There are a bunch of hotels in Giza that are within a 5 minute walk to the main entrance for the pyramids, and they usually have great rooftop views to boot. More on that later.If you’re ready to visit the pyramids, then just head up to the main ticket office and buy your tickets. The scammers and touts will already be trying to chat you up at this point, but you should ignore them.As of 2025, the general ticket price is 540 EGP (~$11 USD) and that gives you admission to the sphinx and the whole area surrounding the pyramids.If you plan to go inside the pyramids themselves, as opposed to just walking around and looking at them on the outside (which is what I did), then you’ll need to buy an extra ticket.The price is 220 EGP for going inside the pyramid of Khafre and Menkaure, or 900 EGP for the pyramid of Khufu.Personally, I don’t think the extra tickets to go inside are worthwhile. The temperature in there can be stifling hot, and the insides were emptied by grave robbers a long time ago.It’s a much better idea to save this money and spend it on a visit to the Egyptian Museum or some of the attractions at Luxor, where you can still see the elaborate tombs and gold artifacts.Anyways, at this point you’ve reached the pyramids and bought your tickets. The security checks at the entrance are pretty brief, and the lines don’t take very long.Just watch your belongings. One time I had cash stolen from my wallet while it was slowly making its way through one of these x-ray machines in Egypt.</p>
